Sentiment Analysis Web App
A machine learning application designed to classify movie reviews as either "Positive" or "Negative". This project serves as a comprehensive, end-to-end example of a typical natural language processing workflow, covering everything from initial data cleaning and model training to the final deployment of an interactive web application with Streamlit.

Key Features
Data Processing: Raw text from the IMDb dataset is rigorously cleaned and preprocessed using Pandas and NLTK. This involves removing HTML tags, filtering out non-alphabetic characters, converting text to lowercase, eliminating common English stopwords, and applying stemming to reduce words to their root form.

ML Model: The classification core is a Scikit-learn Logistic Regression model, a reliable and interpretable baseline for text classification tasks. Textual data is converted into a numerical format using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), which effectively highlights words that are important to a review. This model achieves approximately 88% accuracy on the test set.

Interactive Web App: A clean and intuitive user interface, built with Streamlit, allows for real-time sentiment analysis. Users can input any text, and the app instantly returns the model's prediction along with a confidence score.

Technologies
Modeling & Data Manipulation: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NLTK

Web Frontend: Streamlit

Dataset Source: IMDb Movie Reviews

Local Setup and Installation
To get this project running on your own machine, please follow the steps below.

1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git. This will create a local copy of the project.

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sentiment-analysis-app.git
cd sentiment-analysis-app

2. Install Dependencies
The project relies on several Python libraries. You can install them all at once using the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Note: You will need to generate the requirements.txt file first. See the final section for instructions.)

3. Download the Dataset
The model is trained on the IMDb Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews. You must download this dataset manually from Kaggle.

Download Link: Kaggle IMDb Dataset

After downloading, place the IMDB Dataset.csv file inside the project's root directory.

4. Train the Model
With the data in place, run the training script. This will perform the preprocessing steps and train the Logistic Regression model, saving the final artifacts to disk.

python train.py

Usage
Once the model files (.joblib) have been generated by the training script, you can launch the Streamlit web application.

streamlit run app.py

This command starts a local web server. The app will automatically open in your default web browser, ready for you to use at http://localhost:8501.

Creating requirements.txt
For project reproducibility, it's crucial to have a requirements.txt file. This file lists all the Python libraries needed to run the project. To generate it automatically from your current environment, run this command in your terminal:

pip freeze > requirements.txt
